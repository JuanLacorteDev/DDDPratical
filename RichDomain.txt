## Rich Domain vs Anemic Domain

Rich Domain; occurs when our domain models are not only data structures but also encapsulate business logic and behavior related to protect the integrity of the domain.

Anemic Domain; on the other hand, is characterized by domain models that primarily consist of data structures without any behavior or logic, they are nothing more than
data sacks. In this approach, the business logic is often found in separate service classes, leading to a separation between data and behavior.


Anemic Domain Example:

public class Order
{
	public int Id { get; set; }
	public DateTime OrderDate { get; set; }
	public decimal TotalAmount { get; set; }
}

Encapsulating principle is broken, because order only store data but not control how your own data is manipulated.
No/low coehesion, because your behavior is spread across services.
Harder to maintain, because any change in business logic may require changes in multiple services.
Pontecial for inconsistent state, because there's no guarantee that the data is always valid.

Note: Anemic Domain is considered an anti-pattern to models that represent domain, but it can be useful in some cases as DTO's or Simples cases like CRUD applications.

Another anemic caracteristic is your obssesion for primitive types , like int, string, decimal, DateTime, etc. to represent important data instead of using Value Objects
that hold rules, semantics and are meaningful in the domain context.
