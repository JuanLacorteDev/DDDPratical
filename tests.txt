## Good practices for writing tests DDD 

1 - Validate only the domain. (Total isolation)
Tests of unit should behold and interact only with classes of your domain (VO's, Entities and Aggragate Roots).

2 - Prior the invariant validation.
 Exhaustively test the validation of your Value Objects constructors and Aggregate Root methods
 to ensure that will be throw a domain exception when they receive invalid data.

3 - Name yout tests by intention of business.
 Use names that express the business rule being tested, like:
 "Create_Address_Valid()"

4 - Teste the equality of Value Objects.
Since Value Objects are compared by their values, create tests to ensure that two instances 
with the same data are considered equal.
