## Domain Events

A Domain Event is a significant occurrence or change in state 
within a domain that is of interest to the business or system. 
Domain Events are used to capture and communicate these occurrences between different parts of the system, 
often to trigger side effects or notify other components.

At DDD, events are awalays named in the past tense to reflect that they represent something that has already happened.
Sample: "ApprovedPaymentEvent", "CancelledOrderEvent", "RegisteredUserEvent".

The role of Domain Event is to notify rest of the system about something important happened without concerning
about who is interested in that event or what actions should be taken as a result.

### Characteristics of Domain Events

1. **Immutability**: Once created, a Domain Event should not be modified. It represents a fact that has occurred.
2. **Descriptive Naming**: The name of the event should clearly describe what has happened.
3. **Payload**: Domain Events often carry data (payload) that provides context about the event, such as identifiers or relevant attributes.

Not all events have same importance, so whe have diferent types of Domain Events:

Internal Events:
- They are published and consumed whithin the same bounded context.
- They are used to prapagate local changes inside a bounded context.
- Example: "OrderShippedEvent" within an Order Management context.


Bussiness Events:
- They go through different bounded contexts.
- They comunicate significant facts across the system.
- Example: "ApprovedPaymentEvent" that notifies both Billing and Order contexts.

Bussiness events are those that "change the state of the business" and need to be published to other bounded contexts.
commomly via message, integration events, etc.
