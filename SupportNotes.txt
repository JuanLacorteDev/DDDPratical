## MAYBE A READE ME.md

This project is a practical exercise to study Domain-Driven Design (DDD) to understand its principles and best practices.
The DDD is concept that help us to create software with to model a expressive code, secure and aligned with business rules and not a way to organize folders and files,
it help you to create a rich domain model that encapsulate business logic and rules, instead of anemic domain model that only contain data structures without behavior.
To achieve this we need to express the domain concepts into code as more loyal way as possible.
