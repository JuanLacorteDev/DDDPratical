## Value Objects and Enums in Domain-Driven Design (DDD)

Value Objects encapsulate primitives types that are related and add meaning, validation and behavior to them.
So user VO's to replace primitive types when they represent rules or have specific meaning in the domain, they are immutable and encapsulate validation.
To simple conpects uses Enums and centralize the bahavior in rich domain methods on your entitie.

Minor script to decision:
1 - Does this data has it own rules, behavior or represent a concept in the domain?
If yes, it should be a Value Object. like Address Code, Email, Currency Value, Personal Register Number.

2 - Build Value Objects imutables and robust.
Replace primitive types with imutable classes or user records. (sealed/record)
Validate invariants in the constructor, so your value object will always born valid protecting the domain integrity.

3 - Use Enums to concepts of fixes state.
When a conpect has a limited set of possible values, use Enums to represent them. like: OrderStatus (Pending, Shipped, Delivered, Canceled)

4 - Encapsulate the entity behavior.
Avoid to use public set. Explain methods that express meaning of domain behavior.
This garantee that all the changes to the entity pass by the rules defined in the domain.


Using a value object to replace a primitive type, example DECIMAL for TotalAmount:
public sealed record Currency
{
	public decimal Value { get; }
	public Currency(decimal value)
	{
		if (value < 0)
		{
			throw new ArgumentException("The value canot be negative");
		}
		Value = value;
	}
	public override string ToString() => Amount.ToString("C2");
}

Using a value object to replace a primitive type, example INT for Quantity:
public sealed record Quantity
{
	public int Value { get; }
	public Quantity(int value)
	{
		if (value <= 0)
		{
			throw new ArgumentException("Quantity must be greater than zero");
		}
		Value = value;
	}
	public override string ToString() => Value.ToString();
}



Using Enum to replace string for OrderStatus:
Enum are type of data that consist of a set of fixed named values, used to represent a concept with limited possible states.

public enum OrderStatus
{
	Created = 1,
	Pending = 2,
	Paid = 3,
	Shipped = 4,
	Delivered = 5,
	Canceled = 6
}
