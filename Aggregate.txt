## Aggregate Definition

An aggregate is a cluster of domain objects that can be treated as a single unit. "Eric Evans"
An aggregate will have one of its component objects be the aggregate root. 
Any references from outside the aggregate should only go to the aggregate root. 
The aggregate root can then ensure the integrity of the entire aggregate.

An aggregate is a concept of domain that should keep atomicaly consistent, changes within 
it should be done in a single transaction (all or nothing). 

Aggregate hoot is a main entity inside the aggregate, it is responsible for enforcing the invariants of the aggregate 
and controlling access to its components, being a single point of entry for operations on the aggregate.

Aggregates help to manage complexity in domain models by encapsulating related entities and value objects.


How to identify an Aggregate:

Analise the lifecycle and dependencies od the domain objects.

1 - Which objects share the same lifecycle? - are created, updated , and deleted together.
	If a object cannot exist without your parent object, they probably is a part of this aggregate.

2 - Which objects are strongly coupled by business rules?
    An Order does not existe without OrderItems, and update a OrderItem may affect the Order total.

Plus: Avoid to include in aggragate objects that could be independently modified. Sample: Customer and Product.


How to indetify the Aggregate Root:

The aggregate root is the entity that represents the aggragante externally.

1 - Only the aggregate root should be accessible from outside the aggregate.
    It is the only object that can be referenced by objects outside the aggregate.

2 - The aggragate root is the "chief" of the aggregate. it has the responsibility to enforce 
the invariants and business rules will be not violated.
